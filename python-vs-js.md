# Python vs JS

## no semicolons in Python

n = 1

## no curry braces to denote code blocks, use indentation

1. Use a colon to start a sub-code-block.
2. indent the code within the code block. If you don't indent correctly, it's a syntax error.

```
if n > 1:
  print 'true'

for n in numbers:
  print n
  print n, 'again'

def add(x, y):
  return x + y

```

## plain objects in JS are dictionaries

JS object literal
```
var student = {
  name: 'Allen',
  score: 91
};
```

Dictionary
```
student = {
  'name': 'Allen',
  'score': 91
}
```

## Arrays are called lists


## Constructors are Classes


## Imports instead of requires
